Hey! I've been building an AI-powered expense tracker that works entirely through Telegram. Would love for you to try it out and give me some honest feedback.

**What it does:**
- You text (or voice note, or snap a receipt photo) your expenses in natural language — e.g., "Spent 500 on dinner with Rahul, split equally"
- It parses the expense and logs it directly to your own Google Sheet
- You get daily spending summaries and gentle reminders to log expenses

**Getting started (takes 2 mins):**
1. Open the bot on Telegram — t.me/ExpenseDirectorBot
2. Create a new Google Sheet (or use an existing one)
3. Share the sheet with this email (Editor access): `la-ferrari@dark-quasar-329408.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL — it's the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`
5. Send `/setup <spreadsheet_id>` to the bot
6. Done — start logging expenses!

**Things to try:**
- "Spent 200 on coffee at Starbucks"
- "Auto rickshaw 30 rupees, paid cash"
- Send a voice note with your expense
- Send a photo of a receipt or bill
- "What's my spending this month?"

**What I'm looking for:**
- Does it understand your expenses correctly?
- Is anything confusing in the setup?
- Any bugs or weird responses?
- Features you'd want?

Just text me your feedback whenever — no rush. Thanks for helping out!
